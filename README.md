1 never expect any sort of communication whilst a coder is coding, except the odd grunt and huff. like your annoying them, even though your trying to ask " do you want a brew or food{ you know the normal day to day stuff you need to exsist }".

2 don't expect to go anywhere with your other half (the coder) because the only kind of noise you get is a pphhtt.....and then if you ask again and again i find i generally get the dirtest look,along with a "i can't go anywhere im CODING!!!" no curse words were harmed during the implentation of this sentence
