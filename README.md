__1__ never expect any sort of communication whilst a coder is coding, except the odd grunt and huff. like your annoying them, even though your trying to ask " do you want a brew or food{ you know the normal day to day stuff you need to exsist }". infomation overload then the mastercasion

__2__ don't expect to go anywhere with your other half (the coder) because the only kind of noise you get is a pphhtt.....and then if you ask again and again i find i generally get the dirtest look,along with a "i can't go anywhere im CODING!!!". no curse words were harmed during the implentation of this sentence

__3__ you need an awful lot of patience if your partner is in the world of java script,php etc...... my other half has a full time job outside of coding but still comes home and codes 7 days a week 365 days of the year, his new years day was spent...... yep you guessed it HE WAS CODING, this is the life of a coders partner ie: no life!!!!
