        <h2>the-rant-of-a-coders-partner</h2>
        <p><stromg>1</stromg> never expect any sort of communication whilst a coder is coding, except the odd grunt and huff. 
        like your annoying them, even though your trying to ask " do you want a brew or food{ you know the normal day to day stuff you need to exsist }".</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>2</strong> don't expect to go anywhere with your other half (the coder) because the only kind of noise you get is a pphhtt.....and then if you ask again 
        and again i find i generally get the dirtest look,along with a "i can't go anywhere im CODING!!!".</p>
